# OpenFOAM Paraview Script PostProcessor

The purpose of this workflow is to post-process OpenFOAM results using a user-defined Python script and Paraview's pvpython command. The workflow operates as follows:

1. Search for case.foam files in the specified job directory.
2. For each found file, submit a separate SLURM job.
3. Each SLURM job executes the following command:`pvpython path/to/script path/to/case.foam`

The workflow handles the following tasks:

1. Generate a SLURM batch script for each OpenFOAM case. These scripts are created in the directory `/pw/jobs/<job-number>/<case-name>/sbatch.sh`. The SLURM directives are selected through the input form.
2. Submit each case to the job queue and wait for the jobs to complete execution.
3. Terminate the workflow successfully if none of the jobs encounter any failures.

If the workflow job is canceled on the PW platform, the workflow ensures proper cleanup and termination of ongoing simulations by canceling all associated SLURM jobs. This workflow is designed specifically for post-processing the data generated by the OpenFOAM Runner workflows.
